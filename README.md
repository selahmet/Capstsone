# Capstsone

#Capstone Project Notebook
#Capstone course is going to teach us secondary skills to leverage data to solve a problem.

#This course consists of 5 modules and we are going to learn them by developing a project.
#We will use Foursquare API to get location data in this project.
#In the first three modules, I hope to equip you with all the additional skills you need so that in the remaining two modules, you will be able to work on something exciting of your own creativity.
